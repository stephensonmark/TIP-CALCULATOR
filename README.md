This JavaScript code calculates the tips based on User Inputted bill amounts,
where: 15% is tipped for bills between 50 and 300. 20% is tipped for bills outside this range.
The calcTip function applies this logic, and for each bill in the bills array, it calculates the corresponding tip,
pushing both the tips and total amounts (bill + tip) into the tips and totals arrays.
Finally, the calcAverage function computes the average of any given array,
which is used to calculate the average of both the totals and tips.
